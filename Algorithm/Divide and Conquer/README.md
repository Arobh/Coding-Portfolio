# Introduction to Divide and Conquer Algorithms

Divide and Conquer is a powerful algorithmic paradigm that solves problems by recursively breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subproblems. The core idea is to divide the problem into subproblems, conquer each subproblem independently, and then combine their solutions to solve the original problem. This approach is particularly effective for problems that can be naturally divided into similar subproblems and is widely used in various fields such as computer science, operations research, and optimization.

In this document, we present a comprehensive list of Divide and Conquer algorithms, each with a brief description, typical use cases, and time complexity. These algorithms are essential tools for tackling a range of computational problems, from sorting and searching to more complex geometric and matrix operations.
