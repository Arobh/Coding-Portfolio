# Introduction to Dynamic Programming Algorithms

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful optimization technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. This approach is particularly effective for problems exhibiting overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, allowing for the efficient computation of solutions by storing and reusing previously computed results. DP algorithms are widely applied in various fields, including computer science, economics, and operations research, making them indispensable for tackling a diverse range of challenges.

In this document, we present a comprehensive list of dynamic programming algorithms, each accompanied by a brief description, a typical use case, and its time complexity. These algorithms are fundamental tools in solving problems related to optimization, sequence analysis, combinatorial problems, and more.
